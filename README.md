## What This List Solves

The Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) is a powerful new tool for building AI agents, but the ecosystem is fragmented across many repositories, blogs, and examples. This list addresses three key problems:

1. **Discovery Challenge**: Finding reliable, production-ready integrations and examples in the rapidly growing ADK ecosystem
2. **Quality Verification**: Identifying which community tools and tutorials maintain compatibility with the latest ADK releases
3. **Knowledge Gap**: Connecting developers with educational resources to effectively build multi-agent systems and deploy them at scale

Whether you're building your first ADK agent or architecting complex multi-agent systems, this list will save you time and help you find exactly what you need.
